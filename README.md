Best practices that I try to keep in mind while developing this project: ðŸš€
  - Use a Pub/Sub layer
  - Use Dependency Injection (inversion of control)
  - Loaders [W3Tech microframework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/microframework-w3tec) - similar to net core extensions method used in Startup.cs to add middleware
  - Unit test
